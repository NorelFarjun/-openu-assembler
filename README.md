# Build Instructions

    git clone git@github.com:arthurzam/openu-assembler.git
    cd openu-assembler
    make

# Upload changes

 1. First, always check before you change you are working on latest code version, using `git pull`. If there are merge conflict, contact me if you are unable to fix them :)
 2. Do changes ...
 3. `git add .`
 4. `git commit` : Here you will be asked to fill information about your changes.
 5. `git push` - If it fails here, you don't have the latest changes - will be tough to fix it now, so don't forget step 1.
